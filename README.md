# Tindog
This is my copycat version for tindog website with a littel addition by me.Tindog is a social app for dog lovers who want to connect with other owners nearby that share a similar passion for canines. Based on GPS location, Tindog will suggest nearby matches to help socialize your pet.

This project is made by HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
**The website is responsive to the change of the viewport such as desktop, tablet and mobile**

# index.html
This page is divided into 5 sections and the footer. 
_The first section_ : NavBar that contains hyperlinks to direct to other sections in the same page (contact, pricing and download) and to the **tindog.html** (About). There also a header, buttons and image which are styled using grid system.
_The second section_ : The Features of the app with hover on the icons.
_The third section_ : This sections is made by using bootstrap carousel with 2 buttons for next ant previous.
_The fourth section_ : Pricing section using bootsrap cards.

# tindog.html
To go to this page just click on (About) at NavBar. _The first section_ is just an intro about the app and how it works and the navbar here helps to go back to index.html and the other sections in tindog.html.
_The second section_ : Examples of the dog friends. This section is done by using cards in carousel slids.
The last section is the download buttons.

# styles.css
this file has the style of the 2 pages above.

I also used font-awesome for the icons and google fonts for the different fonts.
